Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I use GitHub primarily as a **repository for source code and technical documentation**, focused on hands-on blue team and SOC analyst workflows. The work here emphasizes practical implementation, defensive engineering, and repeatable analysis rather than high-level conceptual overviews.

My projects sit at the intersection of **SOC operations, security architecture, and AI security**, reflecting how modern detection, investigation, and response workflows are evolving as AI becomes embedded in production environments. Rather than treating AI as a black box, this work highlights guardrails, deterministic decision logic, and analyst-controlled automation—capabilities increasingly expected of SOC L2 and L3 practitioners.

Additional cybersecurity work is documented on my **Notion portfolio** (linked above), which serves as a companion space for **threat hunting investigations, incident response reports, vulnerability management projects, and technical artifacts**. This includes structured materials such as **Cyber Kill Chain infographics, lateral movement investigation templates, and analyst-focused workflow guides**, which complement the source code hosted in this repository.
