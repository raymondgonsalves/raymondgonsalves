Hello, and thank you for visiting my GitHub portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my expertise in cybersecurity, particularly in blue team operations.

MY work sits squarely at the intersection of SOC operations, security architecture, and AI security — and it reflects where many security roles are headed as AI becomes embedded in production workflows.
